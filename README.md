An interactive web application that makes building your own computer a lot easier. Just set your preferences and budget and the app will find the best components for your needs.

The main points that make this app stand out from the others are:
-brand filter
-price point comparison
-business/professional oriented components (workstations)
-detailed images as well as estetics (how does the computer actually look)
-login to save your configuration and shopping cart
-useful tags when searching for best pc/cpu related to your work --> gaming/work oriented
-scores for cpus and gpus to compare and get automated recommendations
-shop for prebuilds
-lots of information for those new to pc building

Some future ideas that i am going to implement:
-cooler recomandation based on cpu tdp
-new recomandations based on profile/account
-future proofing sugestions
-introducing scores and components in the database in a more automated way
